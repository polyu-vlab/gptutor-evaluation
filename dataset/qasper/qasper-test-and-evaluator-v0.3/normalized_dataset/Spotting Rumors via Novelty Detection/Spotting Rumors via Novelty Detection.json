    "question": "What previous methods do they compare against?",
    "ground_truth": "They compare against two other methods that apply message-,user-, topic- and propagation-based features and rely on an SVM classifier. One perform early rumor detection and operates with a delay of 24 hrs, while the other requires a cluster of 5 repeated messages to judge them for rumors."
}{
    "question": "What is their evaluation metric?",
    "ground_truth": "The metrics are accuracy, detection error trade-off curves and computing efficiency"
}{
    "question": "Are their methods fully supervised?",
    "ground_truth": "No. They additionally use similarity to previously detected rumors to make the decision of whether a document is likely to be a rumor"
}{
    "question": "Do they build a dataset of rumors?",
