    "ground_truth": "Answer with content missing: (Content Coverage Constraint section) We thus devise an additional learning constraint based on the nature of content descriptionâ€”each data tuple in the content record should usually be mentioned exactly once in the generated sentence.\nThe copy mechanism over content record x enables a simple yet effective way to encourage the behavior. Intuitively, we want each tuple to be copied once and only once on average."
