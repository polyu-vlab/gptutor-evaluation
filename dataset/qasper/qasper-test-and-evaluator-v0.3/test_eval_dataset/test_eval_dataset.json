We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems.

The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems. Consequently, we don't have to worry about the off-task annotation design since the off-task category is universal. In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer,",

We also apply our method to the PersuasionForGood dataset. As shown in Table TABREF23, MISSA and its variants outperform the TransferTransfo and the hybrid models on all evaluation metrics. Such good performance indicates MISSA can be easily applied to a different non-collaborative task and achieve good performance. Particularly, MISSA achieves the lowest perplexity, which confirms that using conditional response generation leads to high quality responses. Compared with the result on AntiScam dataset, MISSA-con performs the best in terms of RIP and ERIP. We suspect the underlying reason is that there are more possible responses with the same intent in PersuasionForGood than in AntiScam. This also suggests that we should adjust the model structure according to the nature of the dataset. Conclusion and Future Work We propose a general dialog system pipeline to build non-collaborative dialog systems, including a hierarchical annotation scheme and an end-to-end neural response generation model called MISSA.

On-task intents are specific actions relevant to the task, while off-task intents encompass more general dialog acts. This approach allows for detailed supervision, with a focus on designing task-specific on-task categories and semantic slots, while utilizing common dialog acts for off-task intents.

In contrast, the PersuasionForGood dataset defines on-task intents related to donation actions. The off-task intents are universal and include general intents related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence, as well as additional social intents.

Entities in the knowledge base are associated with a set (or probability distribution) of possible surface forms. Given a text to annotate, candidate entities are generated by looking for occurrences of their surface forms in the text.

Research has focused on harnessing features such as lexical, user-centric, propagation-based, and cluster-based features for classification, which are indicative of supervised learning methods (Wu et. al, 2015; Cai et. al, 2014; Liu et. al, 2015). However, the detection of rumours also involves the use of unsupervised techniques such as sentiment analysis and propagation graphs (Qazvinian et. al, 2011; Wang et. al, 2015). The combination of these approaches allows for the assessment of credibility and the detection of rumours in social media streams. Further exploration of the specific supervised and unsupervised methods used in rumour detection research could provide insights into the effectiveness of these approaches."

Recent research mainly focuses on further improving the quality of rumour detection while neglecting the increasing delay between the publication and detection of a rumour. The motivation for rumour detection lies in debunking them to prevent them from spreading and causing harm. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art systems operate in a retrospective manner, meaning they detect rumours long after they have spread. The most accurate systems rely on features based on propagation graphs and clustering techniques. These features can only detect rumours after the rumours have spread and already caused harm. Therefore, researchers like Liu et. al (2015), Wu et. al (2015), Zhao et. al (2015) and Zhou et. al (2015) focus on 'early rumour-detection' while allowing a delay up to 24 hours.

            " Future Work Crowdsourced user studies are widely used for related tasks, such as evaluating dialogue strategies, e.g. BIBREF26, and for eliciting a moral stance from a population BIBREF27. Our crowdsourced setup is similar to an “overhearer experiment” as e.g. conducted by Ma:2019:handlingChall where study participants were asked to rate the system's emotional competence after watching videos of challenging user behaviour. However, we believe that the ultimate measure for abuse mitigation should come from users interacting with the system. chin2019should make a first step into this direction by investigating different response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking) to verbal abuse, and recording the user's emotional reaction – hoping that eliciting certain emotions, such as guilt, will eventually stop the abuse. While we agree that stopping the abuse should be the ultimate goal, BIBREF28's study is limited in that participants were not genuine (ab)users, but instructed to abuse the system in a certain way. BIBREF29 report that a pilot using a similar setup let to unnatural interactions, which limits the conclusions we can draw about the effectiveness of abuse mitigation strategies.

For example, avoidance is most appropriate after sexual demands. (3) All system were rated significantly higher than our negative adult-only baselines - except two data-driven systems, one of which is a Seq2Seq model trained on “clean\" data where all utterances containing abusive words were removed BIBREF1.

However, according to the provided context, data-driven models were found to lag behind rule-based or commercial systems in terms of their perceived appropriateness. The study mentioned in the context suggested that data-driven response generation may need more effective control mechanisms to address abusive behavior [5ad3,1].

Therefore, after looking for 1,000 tweets per 15 more or less equivalent phrases in the three languages, we revised our search words three times by questioning the results, adding phrases, and taking off unlikely ones in each of the languages. In fact, we started our data collection by searching for common slurs and demeaning expressions such as “go back to where you come from”. Then, we observed that discussions about controversial topics, such as feminism in general, illegal immigrants in English, Islamo-gauchisme (“Islamic leftism\") in French, or Iran in Arabic were more likely to provoke disputes, comments filled with toxicity and thus, notable insult patterns that we looked for in subsequent search rounds.

After training $2 \\times 10^4$ steps (batches) on MNLI-m dataset, the performance of LadaBERT-3 is already comparable to TinyBERT after convergence (approximately $2 \\times 10^5$ steps), achieving nearly $10 \\times $ acceleration. And on QQP dataset, both performance improvement and training speed acceleration is very significant.

In this way, the original knowledge in the teacher model can be preserved to the largest extent, and the benefit of which is complementary to knowledge distillation.

Multimodal Neural Language Models were introduced in BIBREF12 , where log-linear LMs BIBREF13 were conditioned to handle both image and text modalities. Notably, this work did not use the recurrent neural model paradigm which has now become the de facto way of implementing neural LMs. The closest work to ours is that of BIBREF0 , who report perplexity gains of around 5–6% on three languages on the MS COCO dataset (with an English vocabulary of only 16K words). Our work is distinguishable from previous work with respect to three dimensions: Model A language model assigns to a sentence INLINEFORM0 the probability: INLINEFORM1  where each word is assigned a probability given the previous word history. For a given video segment, we assume that there is a sequence of INLINEFORM0 video frames represented by features"

The idea behind the Middle and Late fusion is that we would like to minimize changes to the regular RNNLM architecture at the early stages and still be able to benefit from the visual features. Data and Experimental Setup Our training data consist of about 64M segments from YouTube videos comprising a total of INLINEFORM0 B tokens BIBREF14 . We tokenize the training data using a vocabulary of 66K wordpieces BIBREF15 . Thus, the input to the model is a sequence of wordpieces. Using wordpieces allows us to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word issues that would arise from having a fixed word vocabulary. In practice, a wordpiece RNNLM gives similar performance as a word-level model BIBREF16 . For about INLINEFORM1 of the segments, we were able to obtain visual features at the frame level.

Conclusion We present a simple strategy to augment a standard recurrent neural network language model with temporal visual features. Through an exploration of candidate architectures, we show that the Middle Fusion of visual and textual features leads to a 20-28% reduction in perplexity relative to a text only baseline. These experiments were performed using datasets of unprecedented scale, with more than 1.2 billion tokens – two orders of magnitude more than any previously published work. Our work is a first step towards creating and deploying large-scale multimodal systems that properly situate themselves into a given context, by taking full advantage of every available signal.</doc>"

Introduction  INLINEFORM0 Work performed while the author was an intern at Google. Language models are vital components of a wide variety of systems for Natural Language Processing (NLP) including Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Optical Character Recognition, Spelling Correction, etc. However, most language models are trained and applied in a manner that is oblivious to the environment in which human language operates BIBREF0 . These models are typically trained only on",

We opt for the simplest strategy, which concatenates the representations. For a word embedding INLINEFORM0 and corresponding visual representation INLINEFORM1 , the input to our RNNLM will be the concatenated vector INLINEFORM2 . For the examples where we were unable to compute visual features (see Section § SECREF3 ), we set INLINEFORM3 to be a zero-vector. In addition to concatenating the word and"
