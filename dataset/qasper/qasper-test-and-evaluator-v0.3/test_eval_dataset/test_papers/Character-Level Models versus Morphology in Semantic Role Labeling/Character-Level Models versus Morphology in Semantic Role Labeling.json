Alternative ground truth: For all languages, morph outputs the lemma of the token followed by language specific morphological tags.. Alternative ground truth: In addition, English supplies nominal predicates annotated with semantic roles and does not provide any morphological feature.. Alternative ground truth: Datasets are provided with syntactic dependency annotations and semantic roles of verbal predicates."
