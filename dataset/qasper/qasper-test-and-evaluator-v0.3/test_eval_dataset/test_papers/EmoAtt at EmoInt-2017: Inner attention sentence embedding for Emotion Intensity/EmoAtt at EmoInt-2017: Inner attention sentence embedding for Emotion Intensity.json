Alternative ground truth: In general, as Table TABREF13 shows, our intra-sentence attention RNN was able to outperform the Weka baseline BIBREF5 on the development dataset by a solid margin. . Alternative ground truth: While the structure of our introduced model allows us to easily include more linguistic features that could potentially improve our predictive power, such as lexicons, since our focus is to study sentence representation for emotion intensity, we do not experiment adding any additional sources of information as input."
