Alternative ground truth: They compare against two other methods that apply message-,user-, topic- and propagation-based features and rely on an SVM classifier. One perform early rumor detection and operates with a delay of 24 hrs, while the other requires a cluster of 5 repeated messages to judge them for rumors..
