Alternative ground truth: To automatically label the clusters, we combined the grounded knowledge of WordNet BIBREF34 and context-sensitive strengths of domain-specific word embeddings. Our algorithm is similar to BIBREF28's approach, but we extend their method by introducing domain-specific word embeddings for clustering as well as a new technique for sense disambiguation."

Alternative ground truth: First, they  trained domain-specific word embeddings using the Word2Vec  model, then used k-means clustering to cluster the embeddings of the gender-associated words.. Alternative ground truth: The authors first generated a set of words which are associated with each gender, then built domain-specific word embeddings and used k-means clustering to cluster the gendered word associations together.
